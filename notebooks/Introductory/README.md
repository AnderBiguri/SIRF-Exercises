The [display\_and\_projection](display_and_projection.ipynb) notebook is intended as an introduction to SIRF jupyter notebooks. 

The notebook only uses the PET component of SIRF, although for basic uses, both PET and MR aspects are very similar.

## Learning objectives

- Ensure you have a working version of SIRF (whether you're viewing this via a virtual machine, an Azure instance or a SIRF installation on your own machine).
By the end of this notebook, you should feel more comfortable with:
- Get a feel for Jupyter notebooks (and the basic python they require)
- Reading and displaying images
- Querying for help to improve knowledge of SIRF functionality.
